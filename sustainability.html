                            <p> UK supermarkets use 114 billion pieces of single-use plastic a year. Using refillery shops 
                                help to reduce this usage, as customers bring their own jars and bags to fill. This shop is in Newington and only a 15 minute walk from campus!

                            <p>Vintage shopping is sustainable because recycling and reusing items 
                                means fewer polluting resources are being used to make brand new clothing, and also it prolongs 
                                the life of an item and redirects it from landfill. Armstrong's is Edinburgh's iconic vintage shop, with multiple locations around Edinburgh</p>
