# HTB IX Project

This is Team HaveYouSeenPussInBoots2's Hack the Burgh IX Project. 

SustainEd promotes a more sustainable lifestyle to university students, using a rewards system. Students can register using their university email, and can earn points through numerous ways: donating items, using water fountains, and recyclying rubbish. These points can then be redeemed for exciting rewards! 

Our Eco Map - The maps feature provides directions to students for water fountains, recycling points and donation bins where they can donate things they no longer need to other students.

User Rewards - The rewards feature provides students with the incentive to be more sustainable by awarding them points for recycling, using sustainable alternatives to products, donating items etc. These points can be saved up to earn rewards around the university campus.

Sustainable Shopping - This feature recommends sustainability shops to students looking to lead a more sustainable life.

The Marketplace - This feature allows students to sell their things to other students in need.

We were inspired by the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, specifically:
Sustainable Cities and Communities
Responsible Consumption and Production

University students lead busy lives, and are often in poor financial situations, and so focus on finding the cheapest option rather than the most sustainable.

SustainED provides university students with a balanced approach to this dilemma, promoting sustainability through its rewards system.
