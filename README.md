# HTB IX Project

This is Team HaveYouSeenPussInBoots2's Hack the Burgh IX Project. 

Our website SustainED is an online venture designed to encourage university students to lead a more sustainable life. The website has four main features - Maps, Rewards, Sustainability and Marketplace.

Maps - The maps feature provides directions to students for water fountains, recycling points and donation bins where they can donate things they no longer need to other students.

Rewards - The rewards feature provides students with the incentive to be more sustainable by awarding them points for recycling, using sustainable alternatives to products, donating items etc. These points can be saved up to earn rewards around the university campus.

Sustainability - This feature recommends sustainability shops to students looking to lead a more sustainable life.

Marketplace - This feature allows students to sell their things to other students in need.
